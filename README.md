# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
- also known as opinion mining, is a technique used to automatically determine the emotional tone of text-based content.It analyzes text to identify whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral.

## How it works:

### Sentiment analysis employs natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to:   

- Preprocess the text: This involves cleaning the text by removing stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant elements.   
- Extract features: Relevant features like keywords, phrases, and sentence structure are identified.   
- Apply algorithms: Machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models, are used to classify the text based on the extracted features.   
- Determine sentiment: The algorithm assigns a sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral) to the text.   

### Applications:

Sentiment analysis has a wide range of applications across various industries:   

- Social media monitoring: Tracking public opinion about brands, products, or current events.   
- Customer service: Analyzing customer feedback to identify areas for improvement.   
- Market research: Gauging consumer sentiment towards products or services.
